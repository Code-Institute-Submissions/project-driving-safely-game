# Driving Safely

Driving Safely is a game where users attempt to make it successfully through all the scenarios presented, by making the right choice, to reach the destination safely. It is a blend of an interactive story with a quiz to test the user's knowledge of road rules and traffic safety. However, unlike a quiz where you would just receive a score at the end, with this game making the wrong choice can end badly so choose wisely. The game is played via a command line interface so the user would type in the required answer.
